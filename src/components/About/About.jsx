                I am a 4th Year B. Tech Computer
                Science Student studying in Amity University. I have learned various skills that are required in
                web development.
                These slides were showing some of my skills that I hone but I am not limited to these skills only ;&#41;. I have developed many projects using java, django, nodejs in backend and reactjs, angular and bootstrap in frontend. I have a experience as a Web
                Developer Intern in Burgwalden, Germany where I have worked as a SpringBoot Java backend Developer. Currently, I am focusing on learning new skills and experience and problem solving skills through DSA.

                This is my first Project based on Artificial intelligence. This app is mainly based on Question Answer System where user can ask their doubts and question and in the backend user's question are processed through Natural Language Processing through the Middleware GPT-3 Model which uses mixture of DaVince, Babbage and Ada engine to answer that particular given question accordingly.

                Thank You!
